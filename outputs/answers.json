    "answer": "To calculate this, we need to sum up the revenues from Automotive Sales and exclude those from Automotive Leasing:\n\nTotal Automotive Revenue = Automotive Sales + Automotive Regulatory Credits + Automotive Leasing\n= $78,509 + $1,790 + ($2,120 - $356)\n= $78,509 + $1,790 + $1,764\n= $81,063\n\nNow, let's find the percentage of total revenue that comes from Automotive Sales:\n\nPercentage = (Total Automotive Revenue / Total Revenues) * 100%\n= ($81,063 / $96,773) * 100%\n\u2248 84.05%\n\nTherefore, approximately 84.05% of Tesla's total revenue in 2023 came from Automotive Sales (excluding Leasing).",
